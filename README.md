## What's this?

A place to keep my Blender musings and learnables. 

Because we are playing with larger files (textures, fonts and *fbx files from Mixamo), I have also downloaded/installed [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage those larger files. Pretty nifty. One thing, when I installed git-lfs, it messed with my ~/.gitconfig file and changed the email address back to a previous (work) email address. No harm, but totally unexpected.

## Thank you

Thanks to all the Blender developers (especially Ton Roosendaal) for an continually-evolving awesome piece of software.

## YouTube

Also a shoutout to all of the YouTubers that are making me smarter (or at least more appreciative of this art form):

1. [Ian Hubert](<https://www.youtube.com/c/mrdodobird>)
   1. [Lazy Tutorials](<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Dq5VyfewIxxjzS34k2NES_PuDUIjRcY>) (AWESOME!!)
      1. seriously, there are 22 of this little tutorial snippets, and I've watched all of them like 100 times. And it's his voice-over that makes these priceless.
   2. [Industrial JP](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpjN_ZwiEvo&list=PL4Dq5VyfewIyGpbporCr9I2GiHXJ0Dqed>)
      1. not Ian's creation, and nothing to do with Blender -- but hypnotic to watch and nice soundtrack
2. [Erindale](https://www.youtube.com/@Erindale/videos)
   1. [HexWorld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EboNtLKn_m8) tutorial - a thing of beauty; and part of the magic is that he shows how to parameterize a simple scene to change high-level scene aspects.
3. [PolyFjord](https://www.youtube.com/c/Polyfjord) - beautiful tutorials
4. [Redjam](https://www.youtube.com/@redjam9/videos) - these motion graphics looping tutorials are the BOMB!
   1. [Dancing  Cubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27rpd_J8lLk)
   2. [Circles and Spheres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-loF0h56oJw&ab_channel=Redjam9)
5. [Bad Normals](https://www.youtube.com/@BadNormals)
6. [BlenderFoundation](<https://www.youtube.com/c/BlenderFoundation>)
7. [BlenderGuru](https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru) - make a donut, any donut
   1. Andrew Price \( Blender Guru\) was probably my first set of tutorials I watched when really trying to learn Blender. He is VERY thorough and his Donut tutorial really gives you the exercise you need to do something that looks good enough to eat :)
   2. [This subway scene tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb6rSMAooDs) blew my mind - and this is where I learned about BLAM (which then became [fspy](https://fspy.io/))
8. [Blender Secrets](https://www.youtube.com/@BlenderSecrets/videos) - subscribe to their emails. These are short (30 second to 2 minute) videos showing features of, and techniques using, Blender.
9.  [CG Cookie](https://www.youtube.com/@cg_cookie/videos)
10. [CG Geek](https://www.youtube.com/@BlenderMadeEasy/videos)
   1.  [Build a actual city](https://www.youtube.com/@BlenderMadeEasy/videos) from map data - AWESOME
   2.  [Make a donut in 1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0mFLJG_Cyo) - LOL. Fun spin on BlenderGuru's donut series. Narrated in Ian Hubert's voicing style. :D
11. [Ducky3D](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDucky3D/videos) - LOVED his early work (especially the screen-saver-looking, [techno looping videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6jMlmlbiVo&ab_channel=Ducky3D) and [organic/abstract renders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAmfRqaNzSs)). The problem is that he started really pushing product placement in his videos, so they became 1 big ad -- which I grew tired of. But I think he has moved away from that format *somewhat* and has tried to just teach -- he's 75% of the way back...
12. [Iridesium](https://www.youtube.com/@Iridesium/videos) - older version of Blender, but cool effects: explosions, clouds, etc
    1.  [Let's create a Galaxy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCBW4fNAjBg) :D 
13. Misc
    1.  [Nice collection of tutorials to try out](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO7dQ1G8F9z68A85ldEL9nRhBQeafk8jL)
    2.  [Old but good](https://www.youtube.com/@BlenderMadeEasy/videos)
        1.  [Smoke tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iddFzef4H6E&ab_channel=IagoMota) done a while back - still pretty awesome
14. more coming...

## What's this?

A place to keep my Blender musings and learnables. 

Because we are playing with larger files (textures, fonts and *fbx files from Mixamo), I have also downloaded/installed [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage those larger files. Pretty nifty. One thing, when I installed git-lfs, it messed with my ~/.gitconfig file and changed the email address back to a previous (work) email address. No harm, but totally unexpected.

## Thank you

Thanks to all the Blender developers (especially Ton Roosendaal) for an continually-evolving awesome piece of software.

## YouTube

Also a shoutout to all of the YouTubers that are making me smarter (or at least more appreciative of this art form):
